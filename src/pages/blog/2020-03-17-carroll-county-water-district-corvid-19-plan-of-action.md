  Carroll County WATER District - CORVID-19 - Plan of Action - Office Lobby and
  Walk-in Payment Window Closed.
---
In order to better protect our customers and employees and reduce the chances of the corona-virus (COVID-19) impacting the operations of Carroll County Water District #1, the lobby - walk in window will be closed until further notice unless special (schedule) arrangement have been made . Customers are encouraged to pay their utility bills by one of the many other options available including ordinary mail and online methods.  Customers are encouraged to call before coming to the office in person. The secured payment deposit box option for service is still affected at the current time. Customers should call to obtain forms that can be completed before coming to our office.  This will reduce the amount of time waiting in the lobby and speed up the time to process any requests.  We will continue to work hard to provide you good quality service and deliver water to you! 

â€¢	Let's work together and do our part.  Social distancing will help yourself and your loved ones.  "One Team One Fight!"  Thank you!
